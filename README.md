## Overview

Hype SceneMagic is a high-performance JavaScript extension crafted to bring the ease and sophistication of Keynote's "Magic Move" transitions into the realm of Tumult Hype projects. With a focus on delivering visually captivating scene transitions, it bridges the gap between the effortless animations found in presentation software and the often complex world of web development.

### Keynote Inspiration:

If you've ever used Keynote's "Magic Move" transition, you know how it can make objects elegantly glide from one slide to the next. Objects on the first slide automatically find their corresponding counterparts on the next slide and smoothly animate to their new positions. It's a feature that offers both aesthetic and narrative continuity.

### Hype SceneMagic's Answer:

In a similar fashion, Hype SceneMagic identifies "magical" elements within your current and target scenes, performing a visually seamless transition based on pre-defined attributes like `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, `rotateZ`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, and `opacity`. Just like in Keynote, you don't have to manually script each object's movement between scenesâ€”SceneMagic does it for you.

#### Technical Highlights:

1. **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work out-of-the-box with Tumult Hype's native JavaScript API.

2. **Auto-Mapping**: Automatically locates and matches elements across scenes based on class identifiers.

3. **User Experience**: Implements a click-prevention mechanism during transitions to avoid accidental interactions.

4. **Easing Control**: Allows you to specify custom easing functions to get just the right visual effect.

By offering a streamlined API with automatic magic transition capabilities, Hype SceneMagic empowers you to create presentations and web experiences that are as engaging as they are effortless, echoing the convenience and sophistication of Keynote's transitions in a web-centric context.
